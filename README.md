DronePan - 360 aerial panoramas with DJI Inspire 1 and Phantom 3 drones. As of 3/6/16 we're making DronePan open source. Our first goal will be to upgrade to the latest version of the SDK 3.0.1 so we can see if that fixes our duplicate photo bug. Please fork and submit any pull requests. We'll be posting a feature wish list soon.
