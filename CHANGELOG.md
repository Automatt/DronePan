# Change Log

## [1.4.2]

* Update to DJI SDK 3.1
* Faster - we now react to the device saying "finished" instead of waiting - so panoramas should go faster
* Osmo support
* Delay on start (Osmo) - your "get out of shot" time
* Choose number of photos in row
* Choose extra sky row (point the gimbal up to 30Ëš) - aircraft only (Osmo will always do it's full gimbal pitch)
